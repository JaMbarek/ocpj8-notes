#Use  the built-in interfaces included in the java.util.function package such as Predicate, Consumer, Function, and Supplier

Functional interfaces provide target types for lambda expressions and method references. Each functional interface has a single abstract method, called *functional method* for that functional interface, to which the lambda expression's parameter and return types are matched or adapted.

###Predicate

A predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. It can be thought of as a function that returns a value that is either true or false.

In Java 8, a *Predicate* is a functional interface that can be used anywhere you need to evaluate a boolean condition. Since it's a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression wherever a *Predicate* is expected.

See the [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html) to know the methods of this interface.

Here's an example. First, we see how the interface with an anonymous class:
````java
Predicate<String> isALongWord = new Predicate<String>() {
    @Override
    public boolean test(String t) {
        return t.length() > 10;
    }
};
String s = "successfully"
boolean result = isALongWord.test(s);
````
And now with a lambda expression:
````java
Predicate<String> isALongWord = t -> t.length() > 10;
String s = "successfully"
boolean result = isALongWord.test(s);
````
Predicates are also used to filter collections, for example:
````java
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> l = new ArrayList<>();
    l.add("successfully");
    l.add("easy");
    l.add("fortune");
    List<String> filtered = l.stream().filter( s -> s.length() > 5 ).collect(Collectors.<String>toList());
    System.out.println(filtered);
  }
}
````
Here, the filter method expects a *Predicate*, so we can pass a lambda expression to simplify things, so the output of the example is:
````
["successfully", "fortune"]
````

###Consumer

This functional interface represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. The real outcome is the side-effects it produces. Since it's a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression wherever a *Consumer* is expected.

See the [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html) to know the methods of this interface.

Here's an example:
````java
class Product {
  private double price = 0.0;
  
  public void setPrice(double price) {
    this.price = price;
  }
  
  public void printPrice() {
    System.out.println(price);
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Consumer<Product> updatePrice = p -> p.setPrice(5.9);
    Product p = new Product();
    updatePrice.accept(p);
    p.printPrice();
  }
}
````
Basically, what *Consumer* does is executing the assigned lambda expression. The side-effect here, it's the updating of the product's price, so the output is:
````
5.9
````

###Function

This functional interface represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result. One use, for example, it's  to convert or transform from one object to another. Since it's a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression wherever a *Function* is expected.

See the [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html) to know the methods of this interface.

Here's an example:
````java
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 5;
    modifyTheValue(n, val-> val + 10);
    modifyTheValue(n, val-> val * 100);
  }
  
  static void modifyValue(int v, Function<Integer, Integer> function){
    int result = function.apply(v);
    System.out.println(newValue);
  }
  
}
````
The input parameter type and the return type of the method can either be same or different. In this case, they are the same type and the program just execute the functions represented by the lambda expression, an addition and a multiplication, so the output is:
````
15
500
````

###Supplier
This functional interface does the opposite of the *Consumer*, it takes no arguments but it returns some value. It may return different values when it is being called more than once. Since it's a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression wherever a *Supplier* is expected.

See the [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) to know the one method of this interface.

Here's an example:
````java
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;
	    display(() -> n + 10);
	    display(() -> n + 100);
    }
    
    static void display(Supplier<Integer> arg) {
	    System.out.println(arg.get());
    }
}
````
Basically, a *Supplier* just provides values. The output of the example is:
````
13
103
````
